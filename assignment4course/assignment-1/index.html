                  <p class="description">
                    Meat is animal flesh that is used as food. Most often, this means the skeletal muscle and associated fat, but it may also describe other edible tissues such as organs, livers, skin, brains, bone marrow, kidneys, or lungs. The word meat is also used by the meat packing industry in a more restrictive senseâ€”the flesh of mammalian species (pigs, cattle, lambs, etc.) raised and prepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of fish and poultry.

                  <p class="description">
                    Sushi is a Japanese specialty based on shari rice, a boiled rice flavored with sushi meshi, a mix of sweetened Rice Vinegar. Once cooled, the rice has a glossy sheen and separates easily. There is a wide variety of sushi, including nigiri sushi (thin slices of raw fish seasoned with wasabi, a type of green horseradish, and wrapped around or layered with shari rice), hosomaki (thin sushi rolls) and futomaki (thick sushi rolls). To make these rolls, various chopped vegetables, raw fish, pickles, Tofu, etc. are enclosed in shari rice and wrapped in thin sheets of nori (seaweed).

                      pizza
                  </span>
                  <p class="description">
                    Made popular in the United States by soldiers who brought the idea back from Italy at the end of World War II, pizza is thought to have evolved from early Egyptian flat bread. Literally translated, the word means pie, but it has come to represent a round savory tart made with a crisp yeast dough covered with tomato sauce, Mozzarella and other ingredients, such as peppers, onions, Italian sausage, mushrooms, anchovies, and pepperoni. Variations such as the deep-dish pizza, with its thick bread-like crust, have been popular over the years.
